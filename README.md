Currently under development and not ready for public consumption.


Good examples to follow:

- https://docs.icer.msu.edu

TODO:
- [ ] Add something to the github action to check for dead links
- [ ] Something about seff
- [ ] Make note about how it is bad to request multiple cores if tool cannot parallelize and more cores is not always better.
