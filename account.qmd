# Requesting an Account

To request a Mantis account:

1. Submit an [account request ticket](https://health.uconn.edu/high-performance-computing/contact/).
2. Select `New Account Request` from the `Request Type` dropdown menu.
3. Choose `HPC Cluster Account` as the `Account Type`. 
4. Fill in all relevant and required fields and click submit.

Once your request is approved, you will receive an email with your account information. This will include a username which is different from your NetID and a temporary password.

# Passwords
Upon approval of an account request, you will need to enroll in the [CAM Password Manager](https://pm-app.cam.uchc.edu/portal/Home/LandingPage) and reset your password.

Passwords expire every 90 days.

Any time you need to reset your password, you can do so in the [CAM Password Manager](https://pm-app.cam.uchc.edu/portal/Home/LandingPage).

#### Why is it called the CAM Password Manager?
Much of the administration of the Mantis cluster is handled by staff in the Cell Analysis and Modeling (CAM) department.
