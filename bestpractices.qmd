# Data storage practices

## Sharing data with other users
Users often need to share files with others, or work collaboratively in a directory. To do this, you need to set appropriate permissions. You are *not permitted* to open permissions for other users to your home directory `/home/FCAM/<user>`. If you do this, your directory may be locked and you may temporarily lose access to HPC resources. To share or collaborate on work, use a directory in `/labs`, `/projects`, or `/scratch` that you have access to.
