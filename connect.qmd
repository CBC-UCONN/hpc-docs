title: "Connecting to Mantis"
---

<!-- Once you have created a CAM Account there are two ways to connect to the Mantis cluster which are documented on this page:
1. Open OnDemand: a web-based interface for accessing
2. SSH (Secure Shell): a command-line interface


# Open OnDemand -->

# SSH (Secure Shell)
Connecting to the cluster with SSH must be done with an SSH client. Most operating systems have an SSH client installed by default. 

::: {.callout-warning}
When connecting to Mantis over SSH, you will be connected to a login node, also known as a head node. Please do not run anything on these nodes that is computationally demanding as this can negatively impact other users also connecting to these nodes. To do real work, submit a [batch job](submission.qmd#batch-job-submission) or initiate an [interactive session](submission.qmd#interactive-job). Long running or intensive processes found running on login nodes may be killed without notice. This includes some installations such as when using `Conda` or compiling code. When in doubt, it is best to submit a batch job or initiate an interactive session.
:::

## SSH Clients
### Windows users
Windows users on Windows 10 or later can use the built-in SSH client through the `Windows PowerShell`. 

Alternatively, you can use a third-party SSH client such as [MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/).

### MacOS and Linux users
MacOS and Linux users can use the built-in SSH client through the `Terminal` application.

## Using SSH
To connect to Mantis, open a `Terminal` or `Windows Powershell` window and enter the following command:

```bash
ssh <user>@<host>
```

Where `<user>` is your CAM username and `host` is one of the [host URLs](#host-urls) explained below.

#### Example:
```bash
ssh myusername@login.cam.hpc.edu
```

## Host URLs
There are two host URLs you can use to connect to the Mantis cluster:

1. An internal host URL: `mantis-submit.cam.uchc.edu`, which requires you to be connected to the [CAM VPN](#cam-vpn) or to a Secure WiFi network on one of the UConn or UConn Health campuses.
2. An external host URL: `login.hpc.cam.uchc.edu`, which can be accessed from anywhere without a VPN connection, but requires that you have [setup an SSH key](#ssh-secure-shell) for authentication.

### Internal URL
#### `mantis-submit.cam.uchc.edu`
We recommend using this host only for initial [setup of your SSH keys](#ssh-keys) for more secure authentication. This host is only accessible from the UConn or UCHC Secure WiFi networks or through the [CAM VPN](connect.qmd#sec-vpn) and requires password authentication.

When connecting through this host, you will be redirected to one of 4 login nodes:

- `mantis-sub-1.cam.uchc.edu`
- `mantis-sub-2.cam.uchc.edu`
- `mantis-sub-3.cam.uchc.edu`
- `mantis-sub-4.cam.uchc.edu`

::: {callout-note}
CAM passwords expire every 90 days and can be reset in the [CAM Password Manager](https://pm-app.cam.uchc.edu/portal/Home/LandingPage).
:::

### External URL
#### `login.hpc.cam.uchc.edu`
This is the recommended host URL for connecting to the Mantis cluster. It can be accessed from anywhere without a VPN connection, but requires that you have [setup an SSH key](#ssh-keys) for authentication. Authenticaion with SSH keys is more secure than password authentication as well as being more convenient.

When connecting through this host, you will be redirected to one of 3 login nodes:

- `mantis-sub-5.cam.uchc.edu`
- `mantis-sub-6.cam.uchc.edu`
- `mantis-sub-7.cam.uchc.edu`

# CAM VPN
<!--TODO: Move the documentation for vnp here eventually -->

To connect to the CAM VPN, follow the instructions [here](https://health.uconn.edu/high-performance-computing/tutorials/cam-vpn/). 

::: {.callout-note}
Note that the CAM VPN is distinct from the University of Connecticut VPN. 
:::

### Why is it called the CAM VPN?
Much of the administration of the Mantis cluster is handled by staff in the Cell Analysis and Modeling (CAM) department.


# SSH Keys {#sec-ssh-keys} 
SSH keys are a secure authentication method that can be used for remote access to a server without needing passwords. It is in fact a more secure authentication method than using a password. SSH keys consist of a pair of cryptographic keys - a private key kept secret on your computer and a public key placed on the remote server you want to access.

## Creating a public private key pair.
You can create an SSH key pair using the SSH client.  

1. To create an SSH key pair to use with the cluster, use the following command:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C <comment>
````

2. The comment should be something to help you identify which computer this key comes from. For example `<user>-laptop`

3. You will be prompted to specify the location to save the key. You can press enter to accept the default location.

4. Next you will be prompted to create a passphrase which is optional. If you don't wish to create a passphrase, simply press enter.


#### Copy to Mantis
After creating a key pair or if you have an existing one that you want to use, you can copy it to the cluster. 

::: {.panel-tabset}
### MacOS and Linux
On MacOS and Linux, you can copy your public key to the Mantis cluster using the `ssh-copy-id` command:

```bash
ssh-copy-id <user>@mantis-submit.cam.uchc.edu
```

Where `<user>` is your Mantis username.

### Windows PowerShell
On Windows 10 or later, you can copy your public key to the Mantis cluster with `Windows PowerShell` using the command:

```bash
type $env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\id_rsa.pub | ssh <user>@mantis-submit.cam.uchc.edu "cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys"
```

Where `<user>` is your Mantis username.
:::

::: {.callout-warning}
Do not share your private key with anyone! Your private key should be kept secret and secure on your computer. If someone else has access to your private key, they can access the Mantis cluster as you. **We will never ask you for your private key for any reason.**
