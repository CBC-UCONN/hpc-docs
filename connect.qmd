# Connecting to cluster
In order to connect to cluster, you must use an SSH client. See below for instructions based on your operating system.

## On Campus or CAM VPN Host URL
While connected to most networks at the University of Connecticut or Univeristy of Connecticut Health center or if you are connected to the [Cam VPN](), the cluster can be accessed through this host url: 

`mantis-submit.cam.uchc.edu` 

This host is planned to be phased out in the near future so that only the external host explained below will be used.

::: {.callout-tip}
TODO: Appropriate/accurate to say something about load balancing here

- `mantis-sub-1.cam.uchc.edu`
- `mantis-sub-2.cam.uchc.edu`
- `mantis-sub-3.cam.uchc.edu`
- `mantis-sub-4.cam.uchc.edu`

If the redirect fails, you can try logging in directly to one of these hosts.

## External Host URL
The cluster can also be accessed through `login.hpc.cam.uchc.edu` from any network (on/off campus, with/without VPN) but requires that you [setup an ssh key](). 

::: {.callout-tip}
TODO: Appropriate/accurate to say something about load balancing here
This url will redirect you to one of these hosts:

- `mantis-sub-5.cam.uchc.edu`
- `mantis-sub-6.cam.uchc.edu`
- `mantis-sub-7.cam.uchc.edu`

If the redirect fails, you can try logging in directly to one of these hosts.

<!--TODO: Move the documentation for vnp here eventually -->

## SSH Keys
TODO: Explain a bit about what these are and why they are useful.

::: panel-tabset
### Mac/Linux
#### Create a public private key pair.

`ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C <comment> `

Comment should be something to help you identify which computer this key comes from. For example `<user>-laptop`

#### Copy to Mantis

### Windows

`ssh-copy-id <user>@mantis-submit.cam.uchc.edu`
