# Connecting to cluster
In order to connect to cluster, you must use an SSH client. See below for instructions based on your operating system.

## When on campus or logged into VPN:
Use: 
`<user>@mantis-submit.cam.uchc.edu`

Alternatively:
`<user>@mantis-sub-1.cam.uchc.edu`
`<user>@mantis-sub-2.cam.uchc.edu`
`<user>@mantis-sub-3.cam.uchc.edu`

## Can login externally without VPN with:
`<user>@login.hpc.cam.uchc.edu`

This requires an ssh key.


## Mac and Linux Users
An ssh client is installed by default on Mac and Linux operating sytems and can be run from the terminal.

Login with 

`ssh <user>@<host>`

# SSH Keys
Explain a bit about what these are and why they are useful.

### Create a public private key pair.

`ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C <comment> `

Comment should be something to help you identify which computer this key comes from. For example `<user>-laptop`

### Copy to Mantis

`ssh-copy-id <user>@mantis-submit.cam.uchc.edu`
