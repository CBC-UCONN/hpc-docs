# Connecting to Mantis
In order to connect to the Mantis cluster, you must use an SSH client. See below for instructions based on your operating system.

::: {.callout-warning}
When you connect to Mantis, you will be connected to a **login node**. Please do not do any serious computation on these nodes. To do real work, [submit a batch job]() or request an [interactive session](). Long running or intensive processes found on login nodes may be killed without notice.

## Internal Host URL

If you connect to the [CAM virtual private network](connect.qmd#sec-vpn), the cluster can be accessed through this host url: 

`mantis-submit.cam.uchc.edu` 


::: {.callout-tip}
This host will drop you onto one of four login nodes, labeled `mantis-sub-[1-4]`. 
If the redirect fails, you can try logging in directly to one of them:

- `mantis-sub-1.cam.uchc.edu`
- `mantis-sub-2.cam.uchc.edu`
- `mantis-sub-3.cam.uchc.edu`
- `mantis-sub-4.cam.uchc.edu`


TODO: Appropriate/accurate to say something about load balancing here
:::

The internal host is planned to be phased out in the near future so that only the external host explained below will be used.

## External Host URL

The cluster can also be accessed through an external login host available from anywhere (on/off campus, with/without VPN). This host does not allow password authentication,  however, so to use it you must [set up an ssh key](connect.qmd#sec-ssh-keys).

The host URL is:

`login.hpc.cam.uchc.edu` 

::: {.callout-tip}
As above, this url will redirect you to one of these hosts:

- `mantis-sub-5.cam.uchc.edu`
- `mantis-sub-6.cam.uchc.edu`
- `mantis-sub-7.cam.uchc.edu`

If the redirect fails, you can try logging in directly to one of them.

## Using SSH Client

::: panel-tabset

### Mac and Linux Users
An ssh client is installed by default on Mac and Linux operating sytems and can be run from the Terminal App.

#### Connecting
To create a connection, enter the `ssh` command followed by your username and host url like so. 
Login with 

`ssh <user>@<host>` 


### Windows Users

## VPN

To connect to the CAM VPN, follow the instructions [here](https://health.uconn.edu/high-performance-computing/tutorials/cam-vpn/). 

Note that the CAM VPN is distinct from the University VPN. 
<!--TODO: Move the documentation for vnp here eventually -->

## SSH Keys {#sec-ssh-keys} 
SSH keys are a secure authentication method that can be used for remote access to a server without needing passwords. It is in fact a more secure authentication method than using a password. SSH keys consist of a pair of cryptographic keys - a private key kept secret on your computer and a public key placed on the remote server you want to access.

::: panel-tabset
### Mac/Linux
#### Creating a public private key pair.
You can create an SSH key pair 
To create an SSH key pair to use with the cluster, use the following command:

`ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C <comment> `

The comment should be something to help you identify which computer this key comes from. For example `<user>-laptop`

You will be prompted to specify the location to save the key. You can press enter to accept the default location.

Next you will be prompted to create a passphrase which is optional. If you don't wish to create a passphrase, simply press enter.


#### Copy to Mantis
After creating a key pair or if you have an existing one that you want to use, you can copy it to the cluster with the following command:

`ssh-copy-id <user>@mantis-submit.cam.uchc.edu`
