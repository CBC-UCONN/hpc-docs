title: "Job Submission"
---

<!-- TODO: Make a section or another page with example resource requests for common tools -->
<!-- TODO: Make nextflow config and update nextflow section -->

The submit nodes on the cluster should only be used for a limited range of tasks that do not have high computational demands. See the [best practices page]() for more information on appropriate use of the submit nodes. When in doubt it is better to complete a task as a job on a compute node. 

The UCHC Computer cluster uses [SLURM](https://slurm.schedmd.com) for managing and scheduling jobs. 

With SLURM there are two primary ways that a job can be run on a compute node. 

1. [Batch Submission](#batch-job-submission)
2. [Interactive Job](#interactive-job)

# Batch job submission
A batch job submission will take your job script, put it into a queue, and run it for you once the required resources are available. This is the most common way to run jobs on the cluster.

To submit a batch job, use the `sbatch` command.  A basic command might look like: 

```bash
sbatch \
  --job-name <name> \
  --cpus-per-task <cpus> \
  --mem <memory> \
  --time <time> \
  --partition <partition> \
  --qos <qos> \
  --output %x-%j.out \
  <script>.sh
```

Alternatively, the `sbatch` arguments can be specified as a header in your script:

```bash
#/bin/bash

#SBATCH --job-name=<job name>
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=<cpu number> 
#SBATCH --mem=<memory>
#SBATCH --time=<days-hrs:min:sec>
#SBATCH --partition=<partiion name>
#SBATCH --qos=<partition name>
#SBATCH --output=%x-%j.out

<your script here>
```

### Example
Here is a complete example which also demonstrates the use of [SLURM environment variables](https://slurm.schedmd.com/sbatch.html#SECTION_INPUT-ENVIRONMENT-VARIABLES) which access the values of the `--job-name` and `--cpus-per-task` arguments in the job script. Note the use of the `hostname` command to show the node that the job is running on. This information can be useful for debugging jobs. Particularly if you request help from the CBC as we will ask for this information.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --job-name=test-job
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=1 
#SBATCH --mem=100mb
#SBATCH --time=1:00
#SBATCH --partition=debug
#SBATCH --qos=debug
#SBATCH --output=%x-%j.out

hostname

echo $SBATCH_JOB_NAME with $SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK cpus
```
### Required arguments
The following arguments are required when running `sbatch` on the Mantis cluster.
#### \-\-partition
A group of nodes which the job will be allocated to. A partition must be specified when running a job on the Mantis cluster. The available partitions are [explained below](#partitions). 

#### \-\-qos
The qos (quality of service) argument constrains or modifies characteristics of a job. A qos argument must be specified for every job run on the Mantis cluster. This argument will usually be the same as that given for the partition. 

### Commonly used arguments
Below are some of the most useful and commonly used arguments for `sbatch`.
#### \-\-job-name
The name of the job. Used for displaying job information when monitoring the job and for naming log files.

#### \-\-cpus-per-task
The number of cpus to request. The default is 1. More can be requested when a multiple cpus can be used to parallelize tasks.

#### \-\-mem
The amount of memory to allocate. This argument takes a number followed by a unit such as `mb` for megabytes or `gb` for gigabytes. If no unit is given, megabytes are used. If no `--mem` argument is used, a job defaults to 120 MB?

#### \-\-time
Time limit for the job. Jobs not finished by the end of the allocated time will be killed. The value for this argument must specified with the format `days-hrs:min:sec`, `days-hrs`, `hrs:min:sec`, `min:sec`, or `sec`. The default time limit in non-debug partitions is Infinite. However, the time limit has an impact on the priority of jobs in the queue. Jobs with shorter time limits are likely to begin running sooner.

#### \-\-output
This specifies the path of the log file where stdout is written. In the examples above %x is replaced with the job name and %j is replaced with the job ID. See the other file name pattern options [here](https://slurm.schedmd.com/sbatch.html#SECTION_FILENAME-PATTERN)  


#### Additional commands
`sbatch` is a powerful tool with many other configuration options beyond the scope of this documentation.

See the [sbatch documentation](https://slurm.schedmd.com/sbatch.html) for more information about command arguments.


# Interactive Job
An interactive session can be started on a compute node using the `srun` command.

At a minimum, you would use these arguments:

`srun --partition=general --qos=general --pty=bash`

Most `sbatch` arguments can also be used with `srun`. For `--mem` or `--cpus-per-task` if you needed to request additional resources. 


# Job status and monitoring
To monitor the status of your jobs you can run `squeue -u <user>` which will list the status of all jobs that belong to you. See the [squeue documentation](https://slurm.schedmd.com/squeue.html) for additional arguments and output formatting options. 


# Canceling a job
If you need to cancel a job that is currently running or in the queue, you can use the `scancel` command. The basic syntax is:
```bash
scancel <job_id>
```


# Request time extensions
If you have a job that may not finish within the allocated time limit you can [submit a time extension request](https://bioinformatics.uconn.edu/contact-us/xanadu-hpc-job-extension/)


# Partitions
A partition is a group of compute nodes that share certain specifications and policies. Each partition is best suited to different types of tasks.

## general
This partition contains nodes suitable for most tasks. These nodes have 64-128 AMD or Intel Xeon CPUs and 192 GB - 512 GB of ram. Most nodes in this partition have either one NVIDIA A100 or three NVIDIA L40S GPUs. Users can utilize up to 400 CPUs concurrently or with a limit of 400 concurrent jobs in this partition.

## himem
This parition contains nodes suitable for jobs that have very large memory requirements. These nodes have 128 AMD CPUs and 1 TB of ram. Each node in this partition has one NVIDIA A100 GPU. Jobs cannot run in this partition unless 500 GB of memory is requested. Only two jobs per user will run concurrently in this partition.

## debug
This partition is intended for testing and debugging jobs. It has a time limit of only 5 minutes but jobs should start very quickly, allowing you to check for errors before submitting to a queue with potentially longer wait times. 

## preemptible 
Jobs run in this partition my be preempted by higher priority users. This partition is intended for users who are willing to have their jobs interrupted in exchange for potentially lower wait times when nodes are not in use by higher priority users. Jobs with short run times or jobs that can be restartd are good candidates for this partition.


# SLURM Environment Variables
SLURM provides a number of environment variables that can be used in job scripts to access information about the job and the resources allocated to it. See the [SLURM environment variables documentation](https://slurm.schedmd.com/sbatch.html#SECTION_INPUT-ENVIRONMENT-VARIABLES) for a complete list of available variables.


# GPUs
A GPU will not be allocated to a job unless it is explicitly requested. In order to request a GPU, you can specify the `--gres=gpu:[type:]<number>` agrument where the required `<number>` is the number of GPUs to allocate to the job. The `type` is optional and specifies the type of GPU to allocate. The types of GPUs and the associated type arguments are listed in the table below.  

### GPU Types
<!-- TODO: Make this tables not full width of screen -->
| GPU         | type | number per node |
|-------------|------|-----------------|
| NVIDIA A100 | A100 | 1               |
| NVIDIA L40S | L40S | 1-3             |

### Example
```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --job-name=test-gpu
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task 1
#SBATCH --mem=100M
#SBATCH --time=1:00
#SBATCH --partition=debug
#SBATCH --qos=debug
#SBATCH --output=%x-%j.out
##SBATCH --gres=gpu:A100:1

# Detect GPU
nvidia-smi
```


# Feature Constraints
When a job requires specific hardware or software features on a compute node, a user can specify these requirements using the `--constraint=<feature>` argument where <feature> is a defined feature of a node. Multiple constraints can be specified with `&` (and) or `|` (or) operators. The defined features and description are listed in the table below. See the [SLURM documentation](https://slurm.schedmd.com/archive/slurm-18.08.5/sbatch.html#OPT_constraint) for more information on using constraints.

| Feature   | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| cpu_amd   | AMD CPUs |
| cpu_xeon  | Intel Xeon CPUs |
| epyc_7352 | AMD EPYC 7352 CPUs |
| xeon_platinum_8462Y+ | Intel Xeon Platinum 8462Y CPUs |

### Example
Having software compiled for a specific CPU architecture is a common reason to need constraints. For example, if you have software that is optimized for AMD CPUs, you can use the following command to ensure that your job runs on a node with AMD CPUs.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --job-name=test-feature-constraint
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task 1 
#SBATCH --mem=100M
#SBATCH --time=1:00
#SBATCH --partition=debug
#SBATCH --qos=debug
#SBATCH --output=%x-%j.out
#SBATCH --constraint=cpu_amd

lscpu
```

# Job Arrays
If you have a large set of similar tasks that can be run in parallel, job arrays offer a convenient solution for managing these. Job arrays are created using the `--array=<indexes>[%limit]` argument where the required `<indexes>` is a range (e.g. `0-4`) or list (e.g. `1,3,5,7`) of indexes and an optional `limit`, separated by a `%` is the maximum allowed number of simultaneously running jobs (e.g. `%20`). Jobs which are part of a job array will have the environment variable `SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID` set to the array index value for that job. The maximum index allowed in a job array is 5001.

### Example
Here is a basic example where the job array will run 10 jobs in parallel, each with a different index value from 1 to 5. A different `param` value is printed to stdout based on the job index. Only 2 jobs will run at the same time due to the `%2`.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --job-name=test-array-job
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task 1 
#SBATCH --mem=100M
#SBATCH --time=1:00
#SBATCH --partition=debug
#SBATCH --qos=debug
#SBATCH --output=%x-%j.out
#SBATCH --array=1-5%2

params=("A" "B" "C" "D" "E")
param=${params[$SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID-1]}
echo $param

```

Parameter values will often be stored in a separate file. Below are some examples of ways to access these values in a job array script.  

#### Accessing nth line from a text file
```bash
param=$(sed -n "${SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID}p" params.txt)
```

#### Accessing nth value and second column from a csv file
```bash
param=$(sed -n "${SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID}p" params.csv | cut -d ',' -f 2)
```

#### Accessing nth value and second column from a csv file with a header row
```bash
param=$(sed -n "1~${SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID}p" params.csv | cut -d ',' -f 2)
```

# X11 Forwarding

Some applications, such as `R`, can produce graphical output. [X Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System), a.k.a. `X11`, is an option for displaying that output in an interactive session. 

::: {.panel-tabset}
### MacOS

First you need to install [XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org/) on your local machine. 

Then, when connecting to Mantis, use the the ssh option `-X` (or possibly `-Y` if your application requires it) like this:

```bash
# external:
ssh -X <username>@login.hpc.cam.uchc.edu
# or when connected to the VPN:
ssh -X <username>@mantis-submit.cam.uchc.edu
```

Now, to run your software in an interactive session, start it using the option `--x11`. For example:

```bash
srun --x11 --partition=general --qos=general --mem=5G --pty bash
```

Now that you're in an interactive session, you should be able to run your application. 

Try launching `R`:

```bash
R
```

And then plot a histogram of random draws from a normal distribution:

```r
hist(rnorm(10000))
```

The histogram should pop up in an XQuartz window.
