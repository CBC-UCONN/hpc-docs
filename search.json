There are two transfer nodes.\n\ntransfer.cam.uchc.edu which requires a VPN if off campus.\ntransfer.hpc.cam.uchc.edu which requires an SSH key but can be used with/without a VPN or on/off campus. This will soon be the only transfer node available.\n\nA secure copy can be performed from the terminal with the scp command which has this required syntax:\nscp &lt;src&gt; &lt;dest&gt;\nThe src and dest arguments specify file or directory paths.\nAny remote file path must be prefixed with a user ID along with the transfer node address and separated from the path with a colon like so:\n&lt;user&gt;@&lt;hostname&gt;:.\nIn order to secure copy a directory use the -r option.\n\nExamples\nCopy a file from your local computer to your home directory on the cluster:\nscp &lt;local path&gt; &lt;user&gt;@transfer.cam.uchc.edu:&lt;remote path&gt;\nCopy a directory from the cluster to your local computer:\nscp -r &lt;user&gt;@transfer.cam.uchc.edu:&lt;remote path&gt; &lt;local path&gt;",
