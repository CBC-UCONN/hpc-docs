    "text": "Users can connect to the Mantis cluster through a command-line interface using SSH which requires an SSH client.\n\n\nMacOS and Linux users can use the built-in SSH client through the Terminal application.\n\n\n\nSince Windows 10, Windows comes with a built-in SSH client which can be accessed through the Windows PowerShell application. For older versions of Windows, you can use a third-party SSH client such as MobaXterm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nWhen connecting to Mantis over SSH, you will be connected to a login node, also known as a head or submit node. Please do not run anything on these nodes that is computationally demanding as this can negatively impact other users who are also connecting to these nodes. To do real work, submit a batch job or initiate an interactive session. Long running or intensive processes runnong on login nodes may be killed without notice. This includes some software installations such as when using Conda or compiling code. When in doubt, it is best to submit a batch job or initiate an interactive session.\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore being able to login with your SSH client, you will need to setup SSH keys. SSH keys are a secure authentication method that can be used for remote access to a server without needing passwords. It is in fact a more secure authentication method than using a password. SSH keys consist of a pair of cryptographic keys — a private key kept secret on your computer and a public key placed on the remote server you want to access.\n\n\nYou can create a public and private SSH key pair using your SSH client in Windows PowerShell or a MacOS / Linux Terminal.\n\nFirst check for an existing SSH key pair by running the following command:\n\n\nWindows PowerShellMacOS / Linux Terminal\n\n\nls $env:USERPROFILE\\.ssh\\\n\n\nls ~/.ssh/\n\n\n\nIf you see files named id_ed25519.pub and id_ed25519, you already have an SSH key pair and can skip ahead to the Copy to Mantis section. If you do not see any files, you will need to create a new SSH key pair.\n\nTo create a key pair run the following command:\n\nssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C &lt;comment&gt;\nReplacing &lt;comment&gt; with something to help you identify which computer this key pair was created for. For example: laptop\n\nYou will be prompted to specify the location to save the key.

Your private key should be kept secret and secure on your computer. If someone else has access to your private key, they can access the Mantis cluster as you.

Generally cannot be expanded.\nAll users will have a home directory when their account is created.\nThis location is primarily intended for storage of small files such as scripts, source code, configuration, software installations, and can accommodate a small amount of data.\nUse other spaces for analysis of large datasets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nUsers are not permitted to open permissions on their home directories. If you need to share files with other users, try any of the below directories you have access to. If you open permissions on your home directory, it may be locked down.\n\n\n\n\n/labs\nQuota: 2TB. Can be increased upon request.\nIndividual users will always be associated with “lab” groups. PI of the lab group can request a space in /labs.\nThis location is intended for storage of active shared project data to facilitate collaboration among members of a PI’s lab. You will need to be part of the PI’s permission group to access a lab directory.\n\n\n/projects\nQuota: 2TB. Can be increased upon request.\nThis can be created at the request of one or more PIs.\nThis location is intended for storage of active shared project data to facilitate collaboration among multiple groups on a project.\n\n\n/scratch\nQuota: Shared space. No individual or group quotas.\nAnyone can create any number of directories here and set permissions to whatever they choose.\nThis location is intended to serve as temporary storage. This would be an ideal place for the output of intermediate files during analysis. As of last update, /scratch had 84TB of space. Please be considerate of other users of this shared resource.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nIn /scratch unused files are subject to deletion without notice after 90 days.\n\n\n\n\n/sandbox\nQuota: Shared space. No individual or group quotas.\nThis system has identical policies to /scratch. It is in development. At the time of writing (7/25) it was not up.\n\n\n/seqdata\nQuota: Shared space. No individual or group quotas. Users do not have write access.\nThis location is used for storing raw sequencing data and is intended to alleviate strain on quotas in other locations and to discourage data duplication. Data are stored as read-only. You may request that raw data be stored here (all data generated by CGI is stored here by default), but CBC will have to move it there for you, as users do not have write access.\nIf you would like to move existing raw data to this location or store data from an external sequencing center, please contact us at cbcsupport@helpspotmail.com.\nRaw sequence data will be stored here for a period of 2 years. After this time, the data will be moved to /tapearchive/seqdata. See below for more information on /tapearchive.\nDo not copy data from this directory. For convenience, consider making a symlink to files stored here. By avoiding unnecessary copying, accidental data corruption or deletion can be avoided and space will be used more efficiently on the cluster and within directories you own.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nInstead of copying data from /seqdata, create a symlink.\nA symlink, or symbolic link is a pointer to a file or directory that behaves like the real thing.\nIf you want to use data from /seqdata as if it were in one of your project directories you can create a symlink like this:\nln -s /seqdata/CGI/Fastq_Files/AwesomeWGS_May2025/ /home/FCAM/&lt;user&gt;/AwesomeProject/rawData/\nWhere /seqdata/CGI/Fastq_Files/AwesomeWGS_May2025 is the raw data directory and /home/FCAM/&lt;user&gt;/AwesomeProject/rawData/ is the destination. You will then have a symlink, /home/FCAM/&lt;user&gt;/AwesomeProject/rawData/AwesomeWGS_May2025 that behaves just as if the files contained had been copied without taking up all the space.\n\n\n\n\n/tmp\nQuota: Shared space. No individual or group quotas.\nEach node has it’s own local /tmp directory which can be used for temporary storage of data while actively running analyses. This can be desirable when an analysis would be limited by I/O operations across the network.\n/tmp is a shared space. Once an analysis is done, nothing should be left behind here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nOn our system /tmp is pretty small and often fills up. Many programs quietly write to /tmp by default without telling users (they usually quietly clean up afterward as well). If /tmp fills up, no space left on device errors frequently result, confusing users who know they still have plenty of space in their storage quota. If you are running a program that does this, say:\ngenomeAssembler -i mySequences.fastq.gz -o myGenome.fasta\nYou can usually get it to write to another temporary directory by setting and exporting the variable TMPDIR to somewhere else before running it:\nexport TMPDIR=myNewTmpDir # this directory must exist or an error will result\n\ngenomeAssembler -i mySequences.fastq.gz -o myGenome.fasta\nYou can create your own temporary directory where you are doing the analysis, or you can use /local.\n\n\n\n\n/local\nQuota: Shared space. No individual or group quotas.\nThis is another space local to each node and shared among users. It is larger than /tmp but files should be removed immediately after analysis.",

The data are securely stored, being geospread across four data centers. As such, it is relatively expensive for us to store data here.

Think of it as a temporary storage space for files you don’t currently need, but are not ready to delete.\nThis system stores data on magnetic tape. Data stored here goes on a single magnetic tape and is not backed up, though magnetic tape is highly stable.\nAccess to magnetic tape is slow. Depending on how busy the system is, it may take hours or days for data to be written or retrieved. It is, however, inexpensive.\n\n\n/tapearchive\nQuota: No current quota policy.\nThis system is intended for long term storage. Completed projects and datasets that are no longer currently active can be stored here.\nIt also stores data on magnetic tape, but on two redundant copies in the same physical location. Like with /tapebackup, access is slow.\nThis system also includes a seqdata directory where data from /seqdata are moved after a period of 2 years.
