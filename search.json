Generally cannot be expanded.\nAll users will have a home directory when their account is created.\nThis location is primarily intended for storage of small files such as scripts, source code, configuration, software installations, and can accommodate a small amount of data.\nUse other spaces for analysis of large datasets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nUsers are not permitted to open permissions on their home directories. If you need to share files with other users, try any of the below directories you have access to. If you open permissions on your home directory, it may be locked down.\n\n\n\n\n/labs\nQuota: 2TB. Can be increased upon request.\nIndividual users will always be associated with “lab” groups. PI of the lab group can request a space in /labs.\nThis location is intended for storage of active shared project data to facilitate collaboration among members of a PI’s lab. You will need to be part of the PI’s permission group to access a lab directory.\n\n\n/projects\nQuota: 2TB. Can be increased upon request.\nThis can be created at the request of one or more PIs.\nThis location is intended for storage of active shared project data to facilitate collaboration among multiple groups on a project.\n\n\n/scratch\nQuota: Shared space. No individual or group quotas.\nAnyone can create any number of directories here and set permissions to whatever they choose.\nThis location is intended to serve as temporary storage. This would be an ideal place for the output of intermediate files during analysis. As of last update, /scratch had 84TB of space. Please be considerate of other users of this shared resource.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nIn /scratch unused files are subject to deletion without notice after 90 days.\n\n\n\n\n/sandbox\nQuota: Shared space. No individual or group quotas.\nThis system has identical policies to /scratch.\nAnyone can create any number of directories here and set permissions to whatever they choose.\nThis location is intended to serve as temporary storage. This would be an ideal place for the output of intermediate files during analysis. Please be considerate of other users of this shared resource.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nIn /sandbox unused files are subject to deletion without notice after 90 days.\n\n\n\n\n/seqdata\nQuota: Shared space. No individual or group quotas. Users do not have write access.\nThis location is used for storing raw sequencing data and is intended to alleviate strain on quotas in other locations and to discourage data duplication. Data are stored as read-only. You may request that raw data be stored here (all data generated by CGI is stored here by default), but CBC will have to move it there for you, as users do not have write access.\nIf you would like to move existing raw data to this location or store data from an external sequencing center, please contact us at cbcsupport@helpspotmail.com.\nRaw sequence data will be stored here for a period of 2 years. After this time, the data will be moved to /tapearchive/seqdata. See below for more information on /tapearchive.\nDo not copy data from this directory. For convenience, consider making a symlink to files stored here. By avoiding unnecessary copying, accidental data corruption or deletion can be avoided and space will be used more efficiently on the cluster and within directories you own.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nInstead of copying data from /seqdata, create a symlink.\nA symlink, or symbolic link is a pointer to a file or directory that behaves like the real thing.\nIf you want to use data from /seqdata as if it were in one of your project directories you can create a symlink like this:\nln -s /seqdata/CGI/Fastq_Files/AwesomeWGS_May2025/ /home/FCAM/&lt;user&gt;/AwesomeProject/rawData/\nWhere /seqdata/CGI/Fastq_Files/AwesomeWGS_May2025 is the raw data directory and /home/FCAM/&lt;user&gt;/AwesomeProject/rawData/ is the destination. You will then have a symlink, /home/FCAM/&lt;user&gt;/AwesomeProject/rawData/AwesomeWGS_May2025 that behaves just as if the files contained had been copied without taking up all the space.\n\n\n\n\n/tmp\nQuota: Shared space. No individual or group quotas.\nEach node has it’s own local /tmp directory which can be used for temporary storage of data while actively running analyses. This can be desirable when an analysis would be limited by I/O operations across the network.\n/tmp is a shared space. Once an analysis is done, nothing should be left behind here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nOn our system /tmp is pretty small and often fills up. Many programs quietly write to /tmp by default without telling users (they usually quietly clean up afterward as well). If /tmp fills up, no space left on device errors frequently result, confusing users who know they still have plenty of space in their storage quota. If you are running a program that does this, say:\ngenomeAssembler -i mySequences.fastq.gz -o myGenome.fasta\nYou can usually get it to write to another temporary directory by setting and exporting the variable TMPDIR to somewhere else before running it:\nexport TMPDIR=myNewTmpDir # this directory must exist or an error will result\n\ngenomeAssembler -i mySequences.fastq.gz -o myGenome.fasta\nYou can create your own temporary directory where you are doing the analysis, or you can use /local.\n\n\n\n\n/local\nQuota: Shared space. No individual or group quotas.\nThis is another space local to each node and shared among users. It is larger than /tmp but files should be removed immediately after analysis.",

The data are securely stored, being geospread across four data centers. As such, it is relatively expensive for us to store data here.

Data stored here goes on a single magnetic tape and is not backed up, though magnetic tape is highly stable.\nAccess to magnetic tape is slow.

Environment modules are a dynamic way to modify your shell environment, allowing you to easily load and unload different software packages, compilers, and libraries without conflicts. They work by setting up the necessary environment variables (like PATH, LD_LIBRARY_PATH, and MANPATH).\nBelow is a list of commonly used commands, where &lt;module&gt; is the target module.\n\n\n\nModule Command\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nmodule avail\nDisplay all available modules.\n\n\nmodule load &lt;module&gt;\nLoads a specific module into environemnt.\n\n\nmodule list\nShow list of currently loaded modules.\n\n\nmodule unload &lt;module&gt;\nUnloads a specific module.\n\n\nmodule purge\nUnloads all loaded modules.\n\n\n\nThe Mantis cluster uses the Lmod implementation of environment modules.",

Some software is slightly more complicated, but still manageable by novice to intermediate users.\nSome software, however can be very difficult, with a complex chain of dependencies, in which case we often rely on containerization with Singularity or use isolated environments created with Conda",

Containerization is a powerful solution, allowing users to package software and its dependencies into a single, portable unit. Singularity is a container platform that is well-suited for HPC environments and can additionally use Docker images (Docker is the other major containerization platform and unavailable on Mantis).\nSingularity is in your PATH by default so it can be run without loading a module.\nTo get an existing container from a repository, you use the command singularity pull &lt;URL&gt;. For example:\nsingularity pull https://depot.galaxyproject.org/singularity/fastqc:0.12.1--hdfd78af_0\nThis will create the file fastqc:0.12.1--hdfd78af_0, a singularity image (some image files will have the extension .sif). This containst the package fastqc.\nTo run a command (e.g. fastqc --help) inside the container, particularly when submitting SLURM batch scripts, you typically you will use singularity exec &lt;container&gt; &lt;command&gt;:\nsingularity exec fastqc:0.12.1--hdfd78af_0 fastqc --help\nYou can also start up a shell inside the container and explore interactively with singularity shell &lt;container&gt;.\nsingularity shell fastqc:0.12.1--hdfd78af_0\nSee here for a more in-depth tutorial.",
