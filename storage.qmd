Info here about the file system, permissions, quotas, backup policies.


## Quotas
TODO:
What are the quotas?

How can you check your quotas


## Snapshots {#sec-snapshots}
Every night at 3:00AM the system creates a snapshot of the filesystem and preserves this for 10 days.

TODO: The timestamps on snapshots say 11:30?

To recover a file from a snapshot:
1. Enter the snapshots directory with `cd .snapshot`.
2. See the available snapshots with `ls -l`.
3. Choose the desired snapshot date and `cd <name>`. 
4. Copy the file you wish to recover to a location outside of the snapshot `cp <file> <destination>.

::: {callout-note}
The `.snapshot` directory is not visible to the `ls` command but exists for every cluster directory.
:::

## /home/FCAM/\<user\>
All users will have a home directory when their account is created. 

This location is primarily intended for storage of small files such as scripts, source code, configuration, software installtions, and can accomodate a small amount of data. 

Quota: 1TB, can be increased upon request.


## /labs/\<name\>
This location is intended for storage of active shared project data to facilitate collaboration among team members
Intended for data that needs to be accessed by multiple users

Quota: 2TB, can be increased upon request


## /projects/\<project name\>
Created on request to share data among members of collaborative project.

Quota: 2TB, can be increased upon request.


## /scratch
This space is intended to serve as temporary storage. This would be an ideal place for the output of intermediate files during analysis.

Anyone can create a directory here.

Files are removed from this location after **90 days**.

TODO: Should we say something about how much space people can use?


## `/seqdata`
This location is used for storing raw and original sequencing data. Data are stored as read-only. 

**Do not copy data from this directory**. For convenience, consider [making a symlink]() to files stored here. By avoiding unneccessary copying, accidental data corruption or deletion can be avoided and space will be used more efficiently on the cluster and within directories you own. 

If you would like to move existing raw data to this location or store data from an external sequencing center, please contact us at cbcsuport@helpspotmail.com.


## /archive
This location is intended for long term storage of data that is no longer being used for analysis. Eventually, data stored here will be moved to tape storage. <!-- TODO: Say a bit more about the goal of archive and tape. How safe is data here. Does it need to also be stored elsewhere?  -->  

::: {callout-note}
Reading from this directory is slow compared to `/seqdata`. Request that data be moved back to `/seqdata` if you will be actively using the data for analysis.
:::


## /tmp
This space can be used for temporary storage of data while running analysis. Once analysis is done, data need to be moved out of this space. 

The system will remove the contents of this directory after TODO: how long?.
