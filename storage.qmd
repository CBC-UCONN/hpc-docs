# Quotas
TODO:
Explain quotas 

How can you check your quotas? Do we have a script for this?


# Snapshots
Every night at 3:00AM a snapshot of the filesystem is created preserved for 10 days.

TODO: The timestamps on snapshots don't say 3:00. Should we explain why?

To recover a file or directory from a snapshot:

1. Navigate to the parent directory which contained the file or directory that you want to recover.
2. Enter the snapshots directory with `cd .snapshot`.
3. See the available snapshots with `ls -l`.
4. Choose the desired snapshot date and `cd <name>`. 
5. Copy the file you wish to recover to a location outside of the snapshot `cp <file> <destination>.

::: {.callout-note}
The `.snapshot` directory will not be visible in the output of the `ls` command.

# Filesystem Locations
Below is a summary of the primary locations in the cluster file system that users will interact with.

## /home/FCAM/\<user\>
All users will have a home directory when their account is created. 

This location is primarily intended for storage of small files such as scripts, source code, configuration, software installtions, and can accomodate a small amount of data. 

Quota: 1TB, can be increased upon request.


## /labs
This can be created at the request of a PI.

This location is intended for storage of active shared project data to facilitate collaboration among members of a PI's lab. 

Quota: 2TB, can be increased upon request


## /projects
This can be created at the request of a PI.

This location is intended for storage of active shared project data to facilitate collaboration among multiple labs on a project. 

Quota: 2TB, can be increased upon request.


## /scratch
Anyone can create a directory here.

This location is intended to serve as temporary storage. This would be an ideal place for the output of intermediate files during analysis.

Files may be removed from this location after **90 days**.

TODO: Should we say something about how much space people can/should use?


## /seqdata
This location is used for storing raw and original sequencing data. Data are stored as read-only. 

**Do not copy data from this directory**. For convenience, consider [making a symlink]() to files stored here. By avoiding unneccessary copying, accidental data corruption or deletion can be avoided and space will be used more efficiently on the cluster and within directories you own. 

If you would like to move existing raw data to this location or store data from an external sequencing center, please contact us at cbcsupport@helpspotmail.com.


## /archive
This location is intended for long term storage of data that is no longer being used for analysis. Eventually, data stored here will be moved to tape storage. TODO: Say a bit more about the goal of archive and tape. How safe is data here? Does it need to also be stored elsewhere such as SRA?

If you would like to move data to this location please contact us at cbcsupport@helpspotmail.com

::: {callout-note}
Reading from this directory is slow compared to `/seqdata`. Request that data be moved back to `/seqdata` if you will be actively using the data for analysis.
:::


## /tmp
Each node has it's own local `/tmp` directory which can be used for temporary storage of data while running analyses. This can be desirable when an analysis would be limited by I/O operations across the network. 

Once an analysis is done, important data need to be moved out of this space and any other files should be removed. 

The system will remove contents of this directory after TODO: how long or under what conditions?.


# Details
TODO: maybe explain the systems with a bit more detail here?
- disk types of the mounted file systems and protocols in use for those?
- Current system capacity in various locations
