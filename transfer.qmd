title: "Tranferring Data"

We recommend two different approaches for transferring data to and from the cluster.

1) Secure Copy with transfer node
2) Globus Connect

Each are most suitable for different situations. We explain the usage of each tool below.

## Secure Copy
Secure copy is ideal for transferring small amounts of data and is much simpler to use than Globus connect. A secure copy can be performed with the `scp` command. This command can only be used to transfer data to and from the transfer node `transfer.cam.uchc.edu`.

The required syntax for `scp` is:

`scp <src> <dest>`

The `src` and `dest` arguments specify file or directory paths.

Any remote file path must be prefixed with a user ID along with the transfer node address and separated from the path with a colon like so:

`<user>@<hostname>:`.

In order to secure copy a directory use the `-r` option.

### Transfer Host
Using `scp` is only permitted on the transfer 

High availability transfer node: `haxfer.cam.uchc.edu`


### Examples
Copy a file from your local computer to your home directory on the cluster:

`scp <local path> <user>@transfer.cam.uchc.edu:<remote path>`

Copy a directory from the cluster to your local computer:

`scp -r <user>@transfer.cam.uchc.edu:<remote path> <local path>`
