title: "Tranferring Data"

<!-- TODO: Add FileZilla SFTP client -->

There are several recommended approaches for transferring data to and from the Mantis file system.

1. [Secure Copy through transfer node](#secure-copy)
2. [Globus Connect](#globus-connect)
3. [Mounting SMB Share](#mounting-smb-share)

Each are most suitable for different situations. We explain the usage of each tool below.

# Secure Copy
Secure copy is a simple command line method to transfer data. It is ideal for transferring a small amount of data. A secure copy can be performed with the `scp` command. This command should only be used to transfer data to and from a transfer node. There are two transfer nodes:

1. `transfer.cam.uchc.edu` This will accept password authentication or ssh keys and is available from anywhere. 
2. `transfer.hpc.cam.uchc.edu` This is actually three load-balanced servers. it will only accept SSH key authentication and can only be reached through the CAM VPN.

A secure copy can be performed from the terminal with the `scp` command which has this required syntax:

```bash
scp <src> <dest>
```

Where `src` and `dest` arguments specify file or directory paths.

Any remote file path must be prefixed with a user ID along with the transfer node address and separated from the path with a colon like so:

```bash
<user>@<hostname>:2<path> 
```

In order to secure copy a directory include the `-r` option.


### Examples
Copy a file called test.txt from your local computer to your home directory on the cluster:

`scp test.txt <user>@transfer.cam.uchc.edu:`

Copy a directory from the cluster to your local computer:

`scp -r <user>@transfer.cam.uchc.edu:test.txt .`


# Globus Connect
Globus Connect is well suited for large file transfers and for transferring between institutions such as when you need to share files with a collaborator. 

## Getting Started
Globus has excellent [documentation](https://docs.globus.org/guides/). We recommend starting with [this tutorial](https://docs.globus.org/guides/tutorials/manage-files/transfer-files/) which contains almost everything you need to know to use Globus in addition to making note of the specifics below.

### Specifics to accessing the UCHC Globus Server
#### Organizational Login
When first logging in to Globus, you will be prompted to select your organization. You should select the University of Connecticut. If you are not already logged in, you will be prompted to enter your UConn NetID and password.

#### UCHC Globus Server Collection
To access the Mantis file system, search for and select, the `UCHC Globus Server` in the **collection** text field. Upon selecting the UCHC Globus Server, you will be prompted to enter your Mantis username and password.

#### File Paths
Navigation to your home directory mirrors the cluster file system. You can access your home directory by entering `/home/FCAM/<user>` in the **path** text field.

Navigation to other directories has one minor but unintuitive difference. The root of the cluster file system is `/globus` instead of `/`. So, for example, to access the labs directory you would enter `/globus/labs` in the **Path** text field.

## Transferring Files Locally 
In order to transfer files to a local computer, you will need to install the [Globus Connect Personal](https://www.globus.org/globus-connect-personal) application.

## Sharing Files
For a guide on sharing files with Globus, see [this tutorial](https://docs.globus.org/guides/tutorials/manage-files/share-files/).

::: {.callout-note}
When adding permissions, you generally will not need to modify the **Path** test field. The `/` in this case refers to the root of the collection and not the cluster file system.

# Mounting SMB Share
SMB is a network file sharing protocol that allows applications such as your file manager to read and write to files on a remote server as if they were local files. IGV or your browser are other examples of applications which you may want to use to read files directly on the Mantis filesystem. 

To connect to the Mantis file system using SMB and mount one of the directories, you will need to determine the URL or IP address and path of the directory you want to mount. Below is a list of the most commonly used directories and their URLs or IPs. 

| Directory       | Windows                                   | MacOS / Linux                                 |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------  |
| /home/FCAM/home | `\\cfs09.cam.uchc.edu\home\FCAM\<user>`   | `smb://cfs09.cam.uchc.edu/home/FCAM/<user>`   |
| /labs           | `\\cfs09.cam.uchc.edu\labs\<path>`        | `smb://cfs09.cam.uchc.edu/labs/<path>`        |
| /projects       | `\\155.37.251.38\projects\<path>`         | `smb://155.37.251.38/projects/<path>`         |
| /departments    | `\\155.37.250.151\departments\<path>`     | `smb://155.37.250.151/departments/<path>`     |
| /scratch        | `\\cfs08.cam.uchc.edu\ifs\scratch\<path>` | `smb://cfs08.cam.uchc.edu/ifs/scratch/<path>` |
| /sandbox        | `\\155.37.248.191\sandbox\<path>`         | `smb://155.37.248.191/sandbox/<path>`         |

Replace `<path>` with the specific subdirectory path that you want to access.

The `df -h` command can be used to list all of file systems and their URLs.

## Connecting
To connect to the Mantis file system using SMB, you will need to follow the instructions below for your specific operating system. 

When prompted for a username and password, use your Mantis username and password.
